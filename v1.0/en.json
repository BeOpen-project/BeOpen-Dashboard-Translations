NiFi automates cybersecurity, observability, event streams, and generative AI data pipelines and distribution for thousands of companies worldwide across every industry. NiFi was built to automate the flow of data between systems. While the term dataflow is used in a variety of contexts, we use it here to mean the automated and managed flow of information between systems. This problem space has been around ever since enterprises had more than one system, where some of the systems created data and some of the systems consumed data. Nifi also provides a browser-based user interface that enables a seamless experience for design, control, feedback, and monitoring. The possibility to visualize those flows and express them visually can help to reduce complexity and to identify areas that need to be simplified.",

  "minioDescription": "MinIO is a high performance, distributed object storage system. It is software-defined, runs on industry standard hardware and is 100% open source. Trino is a data lake query engine that runs at a high speed. It is directly integrated into MinIO: the objective is to use Trino for query processing and MinIO for data storage. MinIO can handle unstructured data such as log files, backups, tabular data, and container images with a current maximum supported object size of 50TB. It is a high-performance AWS S3 compatible object store. Trino is a distributed, highly scalable query engine, that will be used to access and manipulate data. Trino currently supports SQL based access to data files stored in object storage systems. The tool is not directly accessible, but it is strictly integrated into the platform and in particular in the management and organization of each user's data. The user's private or public data is conveniently stored in MinIO and is accessible through the Data-space section of the BeOpen framework.",
  "fiwareDescription": "Orion is a C++ implementation of the NGSIv2 REST API binding developed as a part of the FIWARE platform. Orion Context Broker allows you to manage the entire lifecycle of context information including updates, queries, registrations and subscriptions. It is an NGSIv2 server implementation to manage context information and its availability. Using the Orion Context Broker, you are able to create context elements and manage them through updates and queries. In addition, you can subscribe to context information so when some condition occurs (e.g. the context elements have changed) you receive a notification. These usage scenarios and the Orion Context Broker features are described in this documentation.",
  "idraDescription": "Idra is a web application able to federate existing Open Data Management Systems (ODMS) based on different technologies providing a unique access point to search and discover open datasets coming from heterogeneous sources. Idra uniforms representation of collected open datasets, thanks to the adoption of international standards (DCAT-AP) and provides a set of RESTful APIs to be used by third party applications. Idra supports natively ODMS based on CKAN, DKAN, Socrata, Orion Context Broker (NGSI v2) and many other technologies: Idra provides also a set of APIs to federate ODMS not natively supported. In addition, it is possible to federate generic open data portals, that don't expose API, using the web scraping functionality or providing a dump file of the datasets in DCAT-AP format. Furthermore, Idra provides a SPARQL endpoint in order to perform queries on 5 stars RDF linked open data collected from federated ODMS and allows to easily create charts based on federated open datasets (through DatalEt-Ecosystem Provider DEEP) Idra is an open source software developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA.",
  "dmmDescription": "The Data Model Mapper tool enables to convert several file types (e.g. CSV, Json, GeoJson) to the different Data Models defined in the SynchroniCity Project. The files in input can contain either rows, JSON objects or GeoJson Features, each of them representing an object to be mapped to an NGSI entity, according to the selected Data Model. In particular, it performs following steps: Parse input file, by converting it into a row/object stream; Streaming: Each row/object coming from the stream is converted to an intermediate object. Mapping: By using the input JSON Map, convert the intermediate object to an NGSI entity, according to a specific target Data Model. Validation and report: Validate resulting object against the JSON schema corresponding to a target Data Model. It leverages AJV JSON Schema Validator. Produce a report file with validated and unvalidated objects. Writing: Orion CB or File Validated objects are sent to the configured Orion Context Broker and/or to a local file. The tool is an open source software developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA.",
  "mqvDescription": "The Metadata Quality Assurance (MQA) methodology is defined by the data.europa.eu consortium with the aim of improving the accessibility of datasets published on EU open data portals. It specifies several indicators that help to improve the quality of the metadata harvested by the data.europa.eu portal. Mqa-scoring is a tool that calculates the score a metadata obtains according to the MQA indicators. The tool also verifies that the requirements specified by the MQA for each indicator are met.",
  "osmDescription": "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, open geographic database updated and maintained by a community of volunteers via open collaboration. Contributors collect data from surveys, trace from aerial imagery and also import from other freely licensed geodata sources. OpenStreetMap is freely licensed under the Open Database License and as a result commonly used to make electronic maps, inform turn-by-turn navigation, assist in humanitarian aid and data visualisation. OpenStreetMap uses its own topology to store geographical features which can then be exported into other GIS file formats. The OpenStreetMap website itself is an online map, geodata search engine and editor. Provides information regarding POI, locations, streets, roads, and other relevant geographical locations, as well as, be used as a database to store newly created geographical open data. The tool is not accessible directly, but is integrated within the BeOpen dashboard, in particular through scripts developed and inserted into the Data-space section.",
  "keycloakDescription": "Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Manager. It allows to add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum effort. Keycloak provides user federation, strong authentication, user management, fine-grained authorization, and more. Keycloak is based on standard protocols and provides support for OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML. In the BeOpen framework, it is the tool that allows access and management of users. Keycloak will be also integrated with all the tools installed on the platform in order to guarantee a single access point to all the framework applications. The tool is directly accessible only by the platform administrator.",

  "openrefineDescription": "OpenRefine is a powerful free, open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data. It operates on rows of data which have cells under columns, similar to the manner in which relational database tables operate. OpenRefine projects consist of one table, whose rows can be filtered using facets that define criteria (for example, showing rows where a given column is not empty). Unlike spreadsheets, most operations in OpenRefine are done on all visible rows, for example, the transformation of all cells in all rows under one column, or the creation of a new column based on existing data. Actions performed on a dataset are stored the project and can be 'replayed' on other datasets. Formulas are not stored in cells, but are used to transform the data. Transformation is done only once. Formula expressions can be written in General Refine Expression Language (GREL), in Jython (i.e., Python), and in Clojure.",
